# Federated Learning Testing

1. Federated Learning on Non-IID Data with Local-drift Decoupling and Correction
Code for paper - **[Federated Learning on Non-IID Data with Local-drift Decoupling and Correction]**

We provide code to run FedDC, FedAvg, 
[FedDyn](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B7v4QMR6Z9w), 
[Scaffold](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B7v4QMR6Z9w), and [FedProx](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06127) methods.

2.  HarmoFL: Harmonizing Local and Global Drifts in Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Medical Images

This is the PyTorch implemention of our paper **HarmoFL: Harmonizing Local and Global Drifts in Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Medical Images** by [Meirui Jiang](https://meiruijiang.github.io/MeiruiJiang/), Zirui Wang and [Qi Dou](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~qdou/).

3. FedUKD: Federated UNet Model with Knowledge Distillation for Land Use Classification from Satellite and Street Views
